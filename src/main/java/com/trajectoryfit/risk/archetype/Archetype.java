 * The five synthetic behavioral profiles used to validate {@link com.trajectoryfit.risk.RiskService}
 * against known-good and known-bad cases before trusting it on real logs. Each is tagged
 * with the risk band it is expected to land in, so the same definitions double as an
 * integration-test fixture and as the seed for synthetic database users.
 *
 * <p>{@code CARDIO_ONLY} and {@code BRAND_NEW} are the load-bearing cases: they prove the
 * model distinguishes "active but not protecting muscle" from "actually at risk", and that
 * it never penalizes missing data as if it were bad data.
