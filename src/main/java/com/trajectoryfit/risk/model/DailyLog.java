/**
 * All of a single calendar day's logged signals, as consumed by the scoring engine.
 * This is the framework-free input type: the persistence layer assembles a window of
 * these from the database (converting stored metric values to the pounds/grams the
 * scoring rules operate in), and the scoring engine reads them without knowing where
 * they came from.
 *
 * <p>Every signal is independently nullable. A {@code null} means "not logged", which
 * the scoring rules treat as absent data (excluded), never as a bad value.
 *
 * <p>Weights are in pounds and lean mass in pounds to keep the port faithful to the
 * validated JavaScript reference; the DB stores metric and converts at the boundary.
